I am a senior at Colorado State University graduating with a Bachelor's in Ecosystem Science & Sustainability and a minor in Sustainable Water in May 2024. I am interested in studying terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. I have experience conducting fieldwork working for the Loch Vale Watershed Long-term Ecological Research and Monitoring Program. Further working for the ROSSyndicate in conjunction with the Rocky Mountain Research Station (USFS) as a Wildfire Effects & Watershed Technician has given me experience working with sondes, collecting water samples, maintaining the weather station, and processing samples. I am passionate about conducting research in order to better understand how ecosystems function post disturbances, such as wildfires as well as other effects caused by climate change. My goal is to work with like-minded individuals and to be part of an organization conducting cutting-edge research.
